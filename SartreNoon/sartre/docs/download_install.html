        <h1 class="title">Download</h1>
    <p>The latest version of Sar<em>t</em>re  can be obtained from
        the <a href="https://sartre.hepforge.org">project web site</a> (hepforge) via svn. The latest version is not always guaranteed to be stable. Safer is it to download one of the tar balls for tagged versions. The tar ball contains all necessary source
         code, lookup tables, and the full documenation (html).</p>
<h1 class="title">Building Sar<em>t</em>re</h1>
    <h2>Supported platforms</h2>
    <p>Although Sar<em>t</em>re is written in ISO C++ and we made sure to adhere
        to strict standards in our code we can only guarantee that it runs on
        the two platforms we tested it on, namely Mac OS and
        Linux (Red Hat) systems. </p>
    <h2>Unpacking the downloaded tar ball</h2>
<pre class="code">
tar -xzvf sartre-&lt;version&gt;.tgz
</pre>
<p>This will create a directory <code>sartre </code>with several
    subdirectories containing source code, include files, tables, as well as
    directories
    for (provided) external programs such as Cuba and Gemini++ that are required
    to build Sar<em>t</em>re.</p>
<h2>Required additional packages</h2>
       <p>Sar<em>t</em>re requires two additional packages to be installed: <a href="http://root.cern.ch">ROOT</a> and
           the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/">GNU Scientific Library</a> (GSL).
           If not already on your system please install them before you continue.
           
Note that ROOT must contain  the <em>Unuran</em> and <em>MathMore</em> components.
           The binary distributions available on the ROOT <a href="http://root.cern.ch">web
           site</a> contain them
           already. If you install ROOT yourself make sure you select them during
           configuration. In case you want to generate tables for specific
models and nuclei not already contained in the latest Sar<em>t</em>re distribution <strong>and</strong> you
want to do so in multithreaded mode (see below) you will need the <a href="http://www.boost.org">Boost</a> library.
For most users this is in general not needed nor recommended.
    <p>Sar<em>t</em>re is using <a href="http://www.cmake.org">Cmake</a> for
        building and installation. If this package is not present please <a href="http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html">install</a> it before continuing.    
    <h2>Building and  installing 
        Sar<em>t</em>re
    </h2>
    <p>Cmake will lookup the locations of the required
        libraries. If ROOT and GSL are not installed in standard locations it
        is recommended to ensure that the following environment variables are
        defined. This helps cmake
        to locate the required libraries and include files:</p>
    <pre class="code">
# example using bash 
export ROOTSYS=/usr/local/root         # must contain lib/ include/ bin/
export GSL_DIR=/usr/local/bin          # must contain gsl-config
# use only when creating tables in multithreaded mode: export Boost_Dir=...</pre>

    <p>Now building and installing Sar<em>t</em>re is easy. We strongly recommend an out-of-source build.</p>
    <pre class="code">
cd sartre-&lt;version&gt;
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..               # note the dot-dot &quot;..&quot;
make
make install  </pre>
    <p>By default Sar<em>t</em>re is installed in /usr/local. Make sure you have
        the appropriate privileges for installation. To chose a different 
        directory use:</p>
    <pre class="code">cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=&lt;mydir&gt; ..
</pre>
<p> This
    will create a Makefile that is setup to install
    Sar<em>t</em>re
    in <code>mydir/sartre</code>.
<p>If (and only if) you intend to create your own tables, a tremendously CPU
    intensive task, you might want to run Sar<em>t</em>re in multithreaded mode.
    To do so you need to pass an additional flag to cmake:
<pre class="code">cmake -DMULTITHREADED=ON .
</pre>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<p>To get started with Sar<em>t</em>re it is strongly recommended to copy the <code>sartre/example</code> directory
    and build upon the examples (especially <code>sartreMain.cpp</code>) in this
    directory. The
    folder also contains the required <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file for cmake
    that you can adapt for you own program.</p>
<p>Note that in order to run Sar<em>t</em>re you need to set the environment
    variable
    <code>SARTRE_DIR</code> to point to the installation directory. For example:</p>
<pre class="code">
# example using bash 
export SARTRE_DIR=/usr/local/sartre</pre>
<p>Then within the example directory:</p>
<pre class="code">
cmake .
make</pre>

<p>Will make all examples. You can also make them individually, for example <code>make
    sartreMain</code>. In case you create you own Sartre project it is recommended
    to use the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file and the <code>cmake/</code> directory
    plus content contained
    in the <code>examples/ </code>directory and modify it to your needs. Otherwise
    you have to write you own Makefile from scratch.</p>
<p>With that you should be set to get started. We recommend to have also a look
    at the <a href="usersGuide.html">Users Guide</a> and for more details we refer to the <a href="referenceGuide.html">Reference
    Guide</a>.</p>
