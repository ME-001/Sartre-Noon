        <p>Sar<em>t</em>re  is an event generator for exclusive diffractive vector
        meson production and DVCS in <em>ep</em> and <em>e</em>A collisions based
        on the dipole model. It can also describe so called Ultra Peripheral Collisions (UPC)
        at hadron-hadron colliders.
        Sar<em>t</em>re describes the processes:<br> 
        <em>e p </em> &rarr; <em>e' V p', <br>
            e A </em> &rarr; <em>e' V A', <br>
            p p </em> &rarr; <em>p' V p', <br>
            p A </em> &rarr; <em>p' V A', <br>
            A A </em> &rarr; <em>A' V A', </em> <br> 
            where V = J/&psi;, &phi;,&rho;, &gamma;. Most common nuclei
        are included. Sar<em>t</em>re 
        is not a stand-alone program but a set of C++ classes and C functions
        that form the API. It is up to the user to provide the main program.
        This scheme gives the user the maximum flexibility to filter, select,
        and store events in whatever format is most convenient for her/him.
        However, a rather complete example main program is provided to get
        the ball rolling. Since Sar<em>t</em>re is quite modular, certain
        classes can be used individually for specific purposes, e.g. for
        numeric calculations of cross-sections or to calculate the kinematics
        of final state particles for a given set of <i>x</i>, <i>t</i>,
        and <i>Q<sup>2</sup></i>.</p>
        <p>The heart of Sar<em>t</em>re is an implementation of the bSat and
        bCGC dipole models developed by H. Kowalski, L. Motyka, and G. Watt
        [<a href="references.html#ref_kmw">1</a>, <a href="references.html#ref_wk">2</a>].
        We extended the models to also describe <em>e</em>A collisions
        making Sar<em>t</em>re the first
        generator to describe this class of processes. Saturation is introduced
        in the bSat model through an exponential term in the scattering
        amplitude. In order to study the impact of saturation on the production
        cross-section            we construct a non-saturated version of
        the bSat model, bNonSat, by linearizing the dipole cross-section.</p>
        <p>To calculate and generate the total cross-sections, rather complex
        integrations have to be performed for each phase-space point (in <em>e</em>A
        around 1000 4D integrals each) rendering an on-the-fly calculation while
        generating events impractical. Therefore, we calculate the first
        and second moments of the amplitudes, for both longitudinally and
        transversely polarized photons separately, and store the results
        in look-up tables. These calculations are very time consuming and were performed
        on the US Science Grid. The tables are contained in the Sar<em>t</em>re
        distribution. The
        look-up tables are three dimensional in <em>Q<i><sup>2</sup></i>,
            W<i><sup>2</sup></i>,</em> and <em>t</em>. There is a set of four look-up
        tables for each species of produced vector meson or DVCS, and for each species
        of colliding nucleus. Currently we provide tables based on the bSat and bNonSat
        models. </p>
        <p>Sar<em>t</em>re thus consist of two parts: an event generator
        part and a table generator part. Most users will only use the former.
        The API and example programs to generate tables are included in the
        distribution
        although we do not recommend to engage in this enterprise unless
        you have massive CPU time available. The event generator part using
        the pre-calculated tables is able to simulate millions of events in
        a matter of minutes on a standard computer. 
        </p>
        <p>This is the first release of Sar<em>t</em>re and we tried hard to
        provide sufficient documentation for the user to get started. However,
        things evolve and many parts might not be as well documented as
        they should be. Please feel free to contact the authors in this case.
        We will try to continuously improve the documentation.</p>
        <p>The best
        way to get started is to use the provided example main program
        (<code>sartreMain.cpp</code>) and runcard (<code>sartreRuncard.txt</code>) and have a look
        at the 
        <a href="usersGuide.html"><font color="#004faf">Users Guide</font></a>. Instead of starting from scratch, it is probably
        more efficient to use the example and modify it to suit your needs.
        For advanced users or users who want to get more out of the generator
        than the example program provides we refer to the 
        <a href="referenceGuide.html"><font color="#004faf">Reference Guide</font></a>
        that explains the various classes in the API in more detail.</p>
        <p>Sar<em>t</em>re relies heavily on components (4-vectors, numeric tools,
        and more) of
        existing packages such as ROOT and GSL that need to be present in
        order build and run it. Making use of existing package reduces the
        code to the essential parts needed and makes things easier to maintain
        and modify. </p>
