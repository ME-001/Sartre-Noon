        <h2>References &amp; Publications</h2>
        <p>Sar<em>t</em>re started originally as an <em>ep</em> only generator
        based on the bSat
        model described in [1]. The parameters, wave function, and parameterization
        for <em>ep</em> are essentially still the same. Sar<em>t</em>re also
        still allows the use of the bCGC model described in the same publication
        but improved in [2]. The parameters for the bNonSat model used in
        Sartre were obtained through fits from a linearized dipole model described
        in [3]. The <em>e</em>A part was developed by the authors of Sar<em>t</em>re
        and is described in ref. [4] where also some details of Sar<em>t</em>re are described.
        We used ideas on how to implement the skewedness and real amplitude corrections
from [5].</p>

        <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
        <p>Many people helped and advised us in developing Sar<em>t</em>re. We
            are grateful to Henri Kowalski for his help with the dipole model
            and the advise he provided on the optimal choice of variables. Lots
            of thanks also to Hannes Jung without whom the final state generator
            would not have happened. Francois Gelis provided us with his DGLAP
            code (including derivatives) and Werner Vogelsang with the &alpha;<sub>s</sub> code.
        Lots of thanks to 
        Raju Venugopalan and Tuomas Lappi who always had an open ear whenever
            we got stuck and patiently answered even the most stupid questions. </p>
        <p>Tobias wants to thank the developer of the Cuba package that answered
            patiently all questions concerning our multidimensional integration
            problems. Thomas wants to express his deep gratitude to R. J. Charity
            from WUSTL, the author of Gemini++. Without
        Bob and his helpful advise we would have not been able to include Gemini
        to handle the nuclear breakup for incoherent diffractive events and make
        it work so flawlessly.</p>
        <p>Last but not least we want to thank Gabriele Garzoglio and especially Marko Slyz and Alexandr Zaytsev.  Without their help we would have not been able to generate the
        massive CPU-intensive calculations of the amplitude tables one the Open Science Grid.</p>
        <p>This work was supported by the U.S. Department of Energy under Grant No. DEAC02-98CH10886.</p>
